        <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional, for depth of flavor)</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>For the Rice</h4>
        <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>4 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h4>For Serving</h4>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley or green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>Hot sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak the Beans:</strong> Rinse and soak the dried red beans in water overnight. Drain and rinse
            before cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vegetables:</strong> Chop the onion, bell pepper, and celery. Mince the garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Sauté the Vegetables:</strong> In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, bell
            pepper, and celery. Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season and Add Beans:</strong> Stir in the smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper,
            and bay leaves. Add the drained beans, tomato paste, vegetable broth, water, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 1.5 to 2
            hours, or until the beans are tender. Stir occasionally, adding more water if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong> While the beans are simmering, cook the rice. In a separate pot, bring 4
            cups of water or vegetable broth to a boil. Add the rice and salt, reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer
            for 18-20 minutes until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Beans:</strong> Once the beans are tender, adjust seasoning with salt, black pepper, and
            soy sauce (if using). Mash some of the beans against the side of the pot to create a creamier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Spoon the red beans over a bed of cooked rice. Garnish with chopped parsley
            or green onions. Add hot sauce for extra flavor if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious red beans and rice!</p>
