    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A warm, golden-yellow cornbread with a slightly cracked top and a moist, crumbly interior. The edges are crisp
        and slightly browned. Often served in slices or squares, with a pat of melting butter on top or drizzled with
        honey for extra sweetness.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey (optional, for added sweetness)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish or a
            cast-iron skillet.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking
            powder, and salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted
            butter, and honey (if using).</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry:</strong> Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just
            combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour into Pan:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish or skillet and spread it
            evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a
            toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Allow the cornbread to cool slightly before slicing. Serve warm with
            additional butter if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your delicious buttery cornbread!</p>
